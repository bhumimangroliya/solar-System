# solar-System
The user is asking for a solar system description using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, likely wanting me to create a single page. I'll produce a responsive, accessible, interactive webpage showcasing the solar system with planets that users can click for more info. After generating the code, I'll direct them to view it.
